Generate a README.md file for projects utilising the 'templar' templating 
engine.

Usage:
    java -jar documentr-all.jar [ <directory> | --help ]

Where:
    <directory> is an optional argument for which directory to look for the
        documentr.json file and generate the README.md.  This defaults to 
        the current working directory
    --help will print out a longer version of the usage message.

This will look for a documentr.json file in the directory, parse it, collate 
the associated resources and generate the documentation.
