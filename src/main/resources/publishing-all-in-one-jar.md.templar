	This project's artefact output is an 'all in one' jar which includes all 
	runtime dependencies.{\n}
	{\n}
	This should appear in the artefact repository along with the compiled code, 
	as a convention, this is usually appended with an `-all` classifier{\n}

	For example:{\n}
	{\n}
	`{archivesBaseName}-{version}.jar -> {archivesBaseName}-{version}-all.jar`{\n}
