The format of the documentr.json file is as follows:

{
	"context": {
		"key": "value",
		"key2": "value2",
		...
	},
	"templates": [
		{ "type": "template-type", "value": "template-name" },
		{ "type": "template-type", "value": "template-name" },
		...
	]
}

The "context" keyed object is a JSONObject of key value pairs, and can be any 
valid JSON values apart from a JSONArray or another JSONObject (i.e., long, 
boolean, string, int).

The "templates" keyed array is a JSONArray of JSONObjects.  Each of the 
JSONObjects, __MUST__ have a key of "type" and "value".  The "type" can only 
be one of the following:

  - template - this is a 'templar' formatted template that will be used and 
        parsed
  - templar - inline templar format tokens - a useful debugging one is:
        {dumpcontext} - which dumps all available context key/value pairs to
        the output
  - file - the file will be included as is with no parsing done on it
  - markup - any valid markdown, with '\n' being replaced with a new line 
        character.  No templar parsing is done on this.
  - inbuilt - one of the in-built templates (see below for a list of the 
        inbuilt templates).
